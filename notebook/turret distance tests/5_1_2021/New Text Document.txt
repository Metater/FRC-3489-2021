     test 1:

tan(theta) = h / d || h1 = 8.5ft (90 in) || h2 = 11ft (132in) || h3 = 10ft (120in) || h4 = 8ft (96in) || h5 = 9ft (108in)

d = 288in

speed for test was 100%

tan(theta) = /288

     theta = x degrees

     test 2:

d = 288in

speed for test was 90.18%

h1 = 8.75 ft (104in) || h2 = 6 ft 11 in (83in) || h3 = 11ft (132in) || h4 = 8.5ft (102in) || h5 = 91in

     test 3:

d = 288in

speed for test was 80.25%

h1 = 80in

PLEXIGLASS TESTS AT MAX? SETTING:

     Test 4:

d = 288in

speed for test was 100%

h1 = 9.25, h2 = 7.7, h3 = 71in, h4 = 144in, 

     Test 5:

results - 24 ft, 3/4 accuracy, 95% power

     Test 6:

results - 18ft, 100% power, 2/5 accuracy

     Test 7:

results - 18ft, 95% power, 5/5 accuracy

     Test 8:

results - 12ft, 100% power, 5/5 accuracy

     Test 9:

results - 12ft, 100% power, 3/3 in small hole

     Test 10:

results - 12ft, 100% power, 1/4 in small hole (11.7 resting volts)

     Test 11:

results - 12ft, 100% power, 1/6 small hole (13.01 resting volts start, 12.8 volts end)

     Test 12:

results - 6ft, no

---------------------------------------------

PLEXIGLASS TESTS AT LOWER SETTING:
	
     Test 13:

results - 6ft, no

     Test 14:

results - 12ft, 75% power, 1/4 small hole, 4/4 big hole

     Test 15:

results - 12ft, 75% power, 3/8 small hole, 8/8 big hole

     Test 16:

results - 18ft, 78% power, 8/8 big hole

     Test 17:

results - 24ft, 84.1% power seemed best

(y = 0.0215x^{2}+72) = decent equation for speeds
